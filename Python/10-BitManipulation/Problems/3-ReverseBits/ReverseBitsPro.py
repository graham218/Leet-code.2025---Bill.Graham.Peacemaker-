    -   Implementing custom network protocols
    -   Optimizing data storage formats
    -   Writing embedded systems code

    -   Educational software
    -   Prototyping new algorithms
    -   Configuration file parsing

    -   High-performance computing
    -   Graphics processing (e.g., texture manipulation)

    -   Network packet processing
