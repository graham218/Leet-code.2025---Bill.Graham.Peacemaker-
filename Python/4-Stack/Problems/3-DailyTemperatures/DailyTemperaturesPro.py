Advanced Daily Temperatures - Real-World Implementations

Problem Statement:
Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list where, for each day in the input,
it tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.
