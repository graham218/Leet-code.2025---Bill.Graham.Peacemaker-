# Approach 4: Cycle Start Detection
def detectCycleStart(head):
    """
    Finds the starting node of a cycle in a linked list, if a cycle exists.  It uses Floyd's algorithm.

    Args:
        head: The head (starting) node of the linked list.

    Returns:
        The starting node of the cycle if a cycle exists, None otherwise.

    Algorithm:
        1. Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (slow and fast pointers) to find the meeting point of the two pointers.
        2. If there is no cycle (the fast pointer reaches the end of the list), return None.
        3. If there is a cycle, reset the 'slow' pointer to the head of the list.
        4. Move both the 'slow' and 'fast' pointers one step at a time.
        5. The point where they meet again is the start of the cycle.

    Explanation:
    Let:
        - X be the distance from the head of the list to the start of the cycle.
        - Y be the distance from the start of the cycle to the meeting point of the slow and fast pointers.
        - Z be the distance from the meeting point back to the start of the cycle.

    When the slow and fast pointers meet:
        - The slow pointer has traveled X + Y.
        - The fast pointer has traveled X + Y + n(Y + Z), where n is the number of times the fast pointer has gone
          around the cycle.

    Since the fast pointer travels twice as fast as the slow pointer:
        2(X + Y) = X + Y + n(Y + Z)
        X + Y = n(Y + Z)
        X = n(Y + Z) - Y
        X = (n - 1)(Y + Z) + Z

    This means that the distance from the head to the start of the cycle (X) is equal to the distance from the
    meeting point to the start of the cycle (Z), plus some multiple of the cycle length (Y + Z).
    Therefore, if we reset the slow pointer to the head and move both pointers one step at a time, they will meet
    at the start of the cycle.
