Problem: Contains Duplicate (Advanced Real-World Implementations)
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

Approaches:
1. Database Query Optimization (SQL-based detection)
2. Distributed Processing (Spark DataFrame)
3. Set-Based Memory-Efficient Duplicate Detection (Replacing Bloom Filter)
4. Streaming Data Processing (Handling Large Data Streams)
5. Cryptographic Hashing (Hash Collisions for Large Datasets)
6. Parallel Processing with Multiprocessing (Optimized for Large Lists)
