def find_min_stock_prices(stock_prices: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Find the lowest stock price in a rotated sorted dataset (Finance).

    This function finds the stock with the lowest price.  In a real-world scenario,
    you might use this to find the best buying opportunity, or to identify the
    lowest value stock in a portfolio for risk assessment.  Note: This function
    assumes the input data is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
    contains stock information, including the price.  It does NOT assume the
    data is sorted or rotated, and uses the built-in min() function.

    Args:
        stock_prices (List[Dict[str, float]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a stock and contains data like "time" and "price".

    Returns:
        Dict[str, float]: The dictionary representing the stock with the lowest price.

def find_min_server_load(server_loads: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Find the server with the lowest load in a rotated dataset (Cloud Computing).

    This function identifies the server with the smallest load.  This is useful
    for load balancing in cloud computing environments, where you want to distribute
    traffic to the least busy server.  It assumes the input is a list of dictionaries,
    each containing server information, and uses the built-in min() function.

    Args:
        server_loads (List[Dict[str, float]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a server and contains data like "server" and "load".

def find_min_energy_consumption(energy_data: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Find the lowest energy consumption in a rotated dataset (Smart Energy Systems).

    This function finds the time period with the lowest energy consumption.  This
    could be used in a smart grid system to identify periods of low demand,
    which can be useful for optimizing energy distribution or scheduling maintenance.
    It assumes the input is a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        energy_data (List[Dict[str, float]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents energy data and contains data like "time" and "consumption".

def find_min_delivery_time(delivery_times: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Find the earliest delivery time in a rotated sorted dataset (Logistics).

    This function finds the earliest delivery time.  In a logistics setting, this
    could be used to find the package that needs to be delivered first to minimize
    overall delivery time.  It assumes the input is a list of dictionaries.
     Note:  This function assumes the times are comparable as strings.  For more
     robust time comparisons, you might want to convert the time strings to
     datetime objects.

    Args:
        delivery_times (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a delivery and contains data like "package" and "time".

    Find the minimum patient wait time in a rotated dataset (Healthcare).

    This function finds the shortest patient wait time.  This can be used in a
    hospital setting to identify the patient who has been waiting the least amount
    of time, which could be useful for prioritizing care or analyzing efficiency.
    It assumes the input is a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        hospital_wait_times (List[Dict[str, int]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a patient and contains data like "patient" and "wait_time".

    Find the lowest temperature reading in a rotated dataset (Weather Monitoring).

    This function finds the lowest temperature reading.  This could be used in a
    weather monitoring system to identify the coldest location, or to track
    temperature extremes. It assumes the input is a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        temperature_data (List[Dict[str, float]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
            dictionary represents a temperature reading and contains data
