/**
 * Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Implementation
 *
 * The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm. It finds the shortest distance between every pair of vertices in a weighted graph.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * graph (number[][]): A 2D array representing the graph's adjacency matrix.
 * - graph[i][j] is the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j.
 * - If there is no edge from i to j, graph[i][j] is Infinity.
 * - The diagonal elements (graph[i][i]) should be 0.
 *
 * Returns:
 * number[][]: A 2D array representing the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices.
 * - The returned matrix dist[i][j] is the shortest distance from vertex i to vertex j.
